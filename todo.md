# TODO

## Imminent
- Crete a visual over the process that happens in the program. 
- Start outsourcing functionality into new files, in `/lib`. 

## Later
- STR.php should not be in DBhandler-folder. It is environmental. 
  - Compare STR and ENV and see what to do. 

- We should not log onto database as `root`. Learn how to create a user.
