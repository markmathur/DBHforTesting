# Folder: testsManual

As opposed to `folder:tests` where unit tests are put for running with PHPunit, *this folder* contains standalone tests that are to be run manually.

## Setup-Run-Breakdown test

This 
- creates a table ('tableForTesting')
- adds a row
- updates it and deletes it
- and finally drops the table. 

On localhost, run it here:  [localhost/DBHforTesting/SRBtest.php](http://localhost/DBHforTesting/SRBtest.php)
