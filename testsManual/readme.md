# Folder: testsManual

As opposed to `folder:tests` where unit tests are put for running with PHPunit, *this folder* contains standalone tests that are to be run manually.

## Setup-Run-Breakdown test

On localhost, run it here (http://localhost/DBHforTesting/SRBtest.php){http://localhost/DBHforTesting/SRBtest.php}
